# Combined LLVM Code Review

## `clang/lib/CIR/CodeGen/CIRGenBuiltin.cpp`

This code snippet appears to be generally correct, however, there are a few minor issues with code style and naming conventions that are worth addressing.

1. Naming conventions: According to the LLVM coding standards, it's recommended to use camelCase for local variables and `camelCase` for method names and symbolic constants. 

2. Code style: The functions and variables should have a brief description using doxygen comments.

Here's a revised version of the code snippet:

```cpp
/// Emit the complex number built-in.
switch (builtinID) {
  case Builtin::BI__builtin_complex: {
    mlir::Value real = emitScalarExpr(e->getArg(0));
    mlir::Value imag = emitScalarExpr(e->getArg(1));
    return RValue::getComplex(real, imag);
  }
  default:
    cgm.errorNYI(loc, "non constant foldable builtin calls");
  }
```

Additionally, according to the LLVM coding standards, comments should be kept brief and to the point. The comment for the switch statement can be shortened to something like:

```cpp
switch (builtinID) {
  case Builtin::BI__builtin_complex:
    // Emit complex number built-in
    // get complex value
    mlir::Value real = emitScalarExpr(e->getArg(0));
    mlir::Value imag = emitScalarExpr(e->getArg(1));
    return RValue::getComplex(real, imag);
  default:
    cgm.errorNYI(loc, "non constant foldable builtin calls");
  }
```

In the above code snippet, the comments are more brief and descriptive. The code itself remains the same and is still correct.

## `clang/lib/CIR/CodeGen/CIRGenExprComplex.cpp`

Overall, the code looks good, but there are a few issues with code style, naming conventions, and clarity that can be improved. Here are some suggestions:

1. The comment `//===--------------------------------------------------------------------===//` is not a standard comment in LLVM code. We can remove it instead.

2. The function `emitLoadOfLValue` is overloaded, which is okay, but the second overload should be declared before the first one to avoid slicing. It would be good to declare them in the order that they are currently declared and move the function definition to the end of the class.

3. The naming convention for functions and variables in LLVM is camelCase, so `emitLoadOfLValue` can be renamed to `emitLoadOfLvalue`.

4. The comment `assert(lv.isSimple() && "non-simple complex l-value?");` is not great, as it would crash if `lv` is not simple. It should be instead `if (!lv.isSimple()) throw Exception("non-simple complex l-value");`.

5. The check `if (lv.getType()->isAtomicType())` should probably be made before the check `assert(lv.isSimple())`. If `lv` has an atomic type, `isSimple()` might not be valid.

6. The function `VisitCallExpr` should probably be renamed, as it does not actually visit the call expression. A better name might be `emitCallResult`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
// Utilities

mlir::Value VisitCallExpr(const CallExpr *e) {
  if (e->getCallReturnType(cgf.getContext())->isReferenceType())
    return emitLoadOfLvalue(e);

  mlir::Location loc = cgf.getLoc(e->getExprLoc());
  mlir::Complex complex = cgf.emitCallExpr(e);
  return builder.createComplexCreate(loc, complex.first, complex.second);
}

mlir::Value emitLoadOfLvalue(const Expr *e) {
  return emitLoadOfLvalue(cgf.emitLValue(e), e->getExprLoc());
}

mlir::Value emitLoadOfLvalue(LValue lv, SourceLocation loc) {
  if (lv.getType()->isAtomicType()) {
    cgf.cgm.errorNYI("emitLoadOfLvalue with Atomic LV");
  }
  if (!lv.isSimple()) {
    throw Exception("non-simple complex l-value");
  }
  const Address srcAddr = lv.getAddress();
  return builder.createLoad(cgf.getLoc(loc), srcAddr);
}
```

## `clang/lib/CIR/CodeGen/CIRGenValue.h`

A code review!

Given the modified lines in `clang/lib/CIR/CodeGen/CIRGenValue.h`, I've identified some issues with code style, naming conventions, and clarity according to the LLVM coding standards.

**Issue 1:** Inconsistent naming conventions
The method `shouldDeferValueAddress` has a camelCase name, which is not consistent with the LLVM coding standards. LLVM prefers underscore-separated names for variables, types, and functions.

**Suggestion:** Rename the method to `should_defer_value_address`.

**Issue 2:** Comment formatting
The comment preceding the `should_defer_value_address` method is not properly formatted. LLVM recommends using a consistent comment format throughout the codebase. Specifically, the first line of the comment should be a single sentence describing the method, followed by a blank line, and then the details of the method.

**Suggestion:** Reformat the comment to match the LLVM coding standards. For example:

/// Returns true if the value's address should be deferred.
///
/// This is used to determine whether the code generator should defer
/// generating the value's address.

**Issue 3:** Variable naming
The variable `result` is not very descriptive. In LLVM code, it's recommended to use more descriptive variable names that indicate what the variable represents.

**Suggestion:** Rename the variable to something like `should_defer`.

Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
/// Returns true if the value's address should be deferred.
///
/// This is used to determine whether the code generator should defer
/// generating the value's address.
bool should_defer_value_address() {
  bool should_defer = ...; // calculate whether to defer
  return should_defer;
}
```
**Additional suggestion:** Consider adding a brief description of the method's purpose in the Doxygen comment. This will help other developers understand the purpose of the method.

## `clang/test/CIR/CodeGen/complex.cpp`

Code review for `clang/test/CIR/CodeGen/complex.cpp`:

1. Since the `foo9` function is supposed to demonstrate a specific use case for complex numbers, the function name could be more descriptive. According to the LLVM coding standards, the naming convention for functions and variables is camelCase or lowercaseWithUnderscores. For example, `foo9` could be renamed to `createComplexNumber` or `complexNumberInitialization`.

2. The comments in the code are mostly generated and do not provide any additional information or clarification. It would be beneficial to include a brief description of what the code is intended to do. This would help other developers quickly understand the purpose and scope of the code.

3. The LLVM IR code generated as part of the CIR test has some minor issues with code styling. The coding standards recommend using consistent spacing and formatting throughout the code. Additionally, the LLVM IR code uses the syntax `%[[TMP_A:.*]] = ...`, whereas in other parts of the LLVM codebase, the syntax is usually `{{TMP_A}} = ...`. It would be better to follow one consistent syntax throughout the code.

4. The code in the `OGCG` section is designed to mimic the `cir` and `alloca` operations seen earlier, which doesn't align with the code standard for LLVM. It seems like a good idea to have consistent naming conventions and formatting throughout the code for better readability.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
// CIR: %[[INIT:.*]] = cir.alloca !cir.complex<!cir.double>, !cir.ptr<!cir.complex<!cir.double>>, ["c", init]
// CIR: %[[TMP_A:.*]] = cir.load{{.*}} {{.*}} : !cir.ptr<!cir.double>, !cir.double
// CIR: %[[TMP_B:.*]] = cir.load{{.*}} {{.*}} : !cir.ptr<!cir.double>, !cir.double
// CIR: %[[COMPLEX:.*]] = cir.complex.create %[[TMP_A]], %[[TMP_B]] : !cir.double -> !cir.complex<!cir.double>
// CIR: cir.store{{.*}} %[[COMPLEX]], %[[INIT]] : !cir.complex<!cir.double>, !cir.ptr<!cir.complex<!cir.double>>

// LLVM: %[[INIT:.*]] = alloca { double, double }, i64 1, align 8
// LLVM: %[[TMP_A:.*]] = load double, ptr {{.*}}, align 8
// LLVM: %[[TMP_B:.*]] = load double, ptr {{.*}}, align 8
// LLVM: %[[TMP:.*]] = insertvalue { double, double } undef, double %[[TMP_A]], 0
// LLVM: %[[TMP_2:.*]] = insertvalue { double, double } %[[TMP]], double %[[TMP_B]], 1
// LLVM: store { double, double } %[[TMP_2]], ptr %[[INIT]], align 8

// OGCG: %[[INIT]] = alloca { double, double }, align 8
// OGCG: %[[TMP_A:.*]] = load double, ptr {{.*}}, align 8
// OGCG: %[[TMP_B:.*]] = load double, ptr {{.*}}, align 8
// OGCG: %[[COMPLEX_PTR:.*]] = getelementptr inbounds { double, double }, ptr %[[INIT]], 0, 0
// OGCG: store double %[[TMP_A]], ptr %[[COMPLEX_PTR]], align 8
// OGCG: %[[IMAG_PTR:.*]] = getelementptr inbounds { double, double }, ptr %[[INIT]], 0, 1
// OGCG: store double %[[TMP_B]], ptr %[[IMAG_PTR]], align 8
```

Please note that these are just code suggestions and the actual code review process may be more detailed and complex depending on the specific requirements of the LLVM project.
